X3D for Video Recognition

I have chosen X3D model to find action from video containing multiple people(eg. normally cctv footage have multiple people performing multiple actions). All of them are performing different actions. To detect and localise each person in the video and classify activities being performed by each individual is broad research area, X3D works better to overcome Spatio-Temporal Detection.

X3D achieves state-of-the-art performance while requiring 4.8x fewer flops and 5.5x fewer params with multiply-adds and parameters for similar accuracy compared to SlowFast model.Â

i have explored different kind of action recognition models(SlowFast,4D CNNs, single frame CNN, Mobile Video Networks (MoViNets)) and like libraries PyTorchVideo, Tensorflow Lite, Keras.

Due to time constraint, only did experiment on slowfast and X3D models using PyTorchVideo library.Both models pre-trained on the Kinetics 400 dataset and tested using sample videos from kinetics 400 dataset.

X3D model perform well and provide similar accuracy 73 to 80 %, the processing time is pretty much fast in cpu.
